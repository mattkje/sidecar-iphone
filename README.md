Enables Sidecar on jailbroken iPhones running iOS 13.2 or higher.

Sidecar is disabled by default on iPhone by Apple, but still remains in the /Applications/ folder. I discovered this when combing through the filesystem shortly after the release of the checkra1n jailbreak. I figured I would head into /Applications/Sidecar.app/ and edit the Info.plist file, enabling the Sidecar app to show on the homescreen, allowing me to test if it would launch or not. Sure enough, it did. I was amazed and began wondering to myself why Apple would not allow Sidecar to run on the iPhone if the technology was there. That is what led to me deciding to make this project along with a guide for jailbroken users that explains, in detail, how to enable and make Sidecar function on the iPhone.

NOTE: This guide will help you disable the blacklist for iPhones in macOS. This also requires you to make some edits to the root filesystem on your iPhone, which requires a jailbreak. You will need to use checkra1n. Tested with macOS 10.15 (19A583) and iPhone 7 Plus (iOS 13.2.2).
